# Web-app-with-Blazor-WebAssembly


This repository is based on [Microsoft Learn Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-blazor-webassembly-visual-studio-code/). 

While doing this, I learned how to set up your development environment and build my first WebAssembly app with Blazor, Visual Studio Code, and C#.


In this module, you would learn :

+ Configuring local environment for Blazor development with Visual Studio Code
+ Creating a new Blazor WebAssembly project
+ Adding client-side logic to a Blazor web app.

### How to run this app?

+ First clone this repository using

```

git clone https://github.com/sajeetharan/Web-app-Blazor-WebAssembly.git

```

+ Install [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) by downloading the latest version for your operating system

+ Open the Extension browser on your [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

+ Search for **C# for Visual Studio Code** and Install **C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)**

+ Search for **JavaScript Debugger** and install **JavaScript Debugger (Nightly)**

+ Right-click on **JavaScript Debugger (Nightly)** from the list of Enabled extensions (after installation is complete) and select **Extension Settings**

+ Scroll and find the **Debug > JavaScript Use Preview** setting

+ Navigate to the folder of this cloned repo.

+ From the command prompt or terminal `dotnet run` to launch the app

+ Open a web browser to `https://localhost:5001`

![The Demo you would get](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-blazor-webassembly-visual-studio-code/media/calculator-app.png)
You can find something similar to this.

+ Return to the terminal in Visual Studio code and press "Ctrl-C" to stop the app.
